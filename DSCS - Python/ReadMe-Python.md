# Digivolution Tracker

## Purpose

This application is designed to help the user find connections between various Digimon Lines and be able to carry their 
Digimon to new places. This means that you would be able to create Digimon with specific skill lists and end at a 
particular Digimon.

## Challenges

This is all graph theory across a undirected graph with 240 nodes which can have upwards of 8 edges. Due to my limited 
understanding of graph theory, I know that this endeavor will be difficult and will probably lead to hours of hair 
pulling and frustration. I do find it good practice to get into a language.

## Test Cases that Seem to cause Trouble

These are some cases that I ran into where it was difficult for me to get the correct answer via code, even though there 
may exists some connection between them

### Connection Found
- RustTyranomon to Mastemon [RustTyranomon -> MetalGreymon => Ommimon => MetalGarurumon -> Zudomon -> Frigimon => Angewoman => Mastemon]
- PrinceMamemon to Mastemon
